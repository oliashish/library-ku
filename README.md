# library-ku

- This is a library management project that I'm doing for my own college library. This is or will not be a fully equiped website.This is just a prototype or what approximately all can happen in a college library website.

## Aim
- The aim is to provide the management a prototype for the library management app that could prove to be a easy medium for student to communicate to college library and help themselves.
- The fundamental logic of the app is to get issue I-card, issue books(or reserve them for them so that they can get them easily without any loss of efforts and time), return books on time to help others.

### The project is still going on.
